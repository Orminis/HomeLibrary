Home Library List

The idea for this project is to be used as personal list about owned books.

Users can create information for books if they are not in the database, which then are checked by checkers or admins
for validation. After approval the book information is transferred to main db tables which are visible by all users.

Users can add or remove approved books to personal collections.

TODO: Users to create specific collection "Shelves" in which to transfer owned books.
TODO: Comments and ratings to different books
TODO: Table for authors and relationship to other book tables.


The project is in very basic stage.
